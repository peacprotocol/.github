## A Universal Policy Layer for the Automated Economy

PEAC (Programmable Economic Access, Attribution & Consent) Protocol is an open standard that enables content creators, publishers, and automated systems to negotiate access, payments, and compliance programmatically. Building on proven web standards, PEAC establishes a machine-readable policy file (peac.txt) that works alongside existing infrastructure.

## What is PEAC Protocol?

PEAC Protocol provides a standardized framework for:
- Programmable access control and consent management
- Automated micropayments for content usage
- Verifiable attribution chains
- Regulatory compliance automation

The protocol addresses the growing need for fair value exchange between content creators and AI systems, while ensuring compliance with global regulations.

## Why PEAC Protocol?

As automated systems increasingly interact with web content, the need for programmable policies becomes critical. PEAC enables:

- **Publishers**: Monetize content access while maintaining control
- **AI Systems**: Access content legally with clear terms
- **Platforms**: Automate compliance and reduce legal risk
- **Users**: Transparent data usage and privacy protection
