## PEAC Protocol is an open standard for programmable access, consent, attribution, and automated machine-to-machine payments.

It enables publishers, platforms, AI/data agents, and regulators to specify and enforce economic, consent, and attribution terms via a simple, auditable file: `pricing.txt` or `.well-known/peac.json`. Payments and advanced enforcement are optional for non-commercial or open access, ensuring win-win for creators and agents.
