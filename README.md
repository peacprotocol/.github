PEAC Protocol is an open, neutral standard for programmable economic access, attribution, and consent on the web.

We enable publishers, AI agents, platforms, and individuals to specify, negotiate, and enforce dynamic access, consent, attribution, and pricing terms with a simple, machine-readable contract.

Our mission: Sustain an open, programmable web economy where data, value, and consent flow seamlessly and fairly between all stakeholders, human or agent.
